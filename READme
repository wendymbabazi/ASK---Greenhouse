**The Skill: Web Development & Client Solutions**

**Why I built this:**
I wanted to show how technical design can directly solve a business's problem. For a local venture like **ASK Green House**, a website isn't just about code—it's about making it easy for customers to order fresh produce. This project is a direct result of my **Computer Science** training and my focus on ensuring technology meets actual user needs. 

**Key Technical Features:**

* 
**Integrated Responsive Design:** I used custom CSS to ensure the site looks professional on both mobile phones (for farmers/customers on the go) and desktop computers. 


* 
**User-Centric Navigation:** Built with semantic HTML to prioritize the most important information: what they grow and how to buy it. 


* **Business Integration:** Features a direct WhatsApp link and order form to turn visitors into active clients instantly.
