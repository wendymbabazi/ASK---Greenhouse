### **The Skill: Web Design & Business Solutions**

**Why I built this:**

**Key Features:**

* **Modern CSS:** Uses variables and a grid system for a clean, professional look.
* **Mobile Responsive:** Works perfectly on phones and desktops.
* **Business Tools:** Includes a WhatsApp integration and a custom order form to capture leads.
* **Clean Code:** Built with semantic HTML for better search engine visibility.
